Smart Contract flow consideration:

1. Currently i still not sure for block time stamp that include currently in contract.
It could be overriden by startElection function, but it is actually still not meets my expectation.
The actual design is to create some scheduled Election Event. In near future i will redesign this schedule flow.
2. For the final election result, i have consideration to store this info into web3.storage,after taken Election data from smart contract
